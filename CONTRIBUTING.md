## Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Trinsic Labs Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to
[david@davidcraig.co.nz](mailto:david@davidcraig.co.nz).

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these
guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report,
reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing
> that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
> issue in the body of your new one.

#### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue
and explain the problem, including additional details to help maintainers
reproduce the issue:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many
details as possible.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point
out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Specify the name and version of the browser and OS you're using.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Suggesting enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including
completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your
suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### How do I submit a (good) enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on
that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to
identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as
many details as possible.
* **Describe the current behavior** and
**explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
* **List other software / applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain project quality.
* Fix problems that are important to users.
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible product.
* Enable a sustainable system for project maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all
[status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are
passing.
<details>
  <summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>
  If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated
  to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you
  believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status
  check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we
  will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.
</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull
request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design
work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can
be ultimately accepted.
