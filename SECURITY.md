# Security Policy

The Trinsic Labs team take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts
to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email
[david@davidcraig.co.nz](mailto:david@davidcraig.co.nz) and include the word
"SECURITY" in the subject line.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.
